# water-data-cleaning
SQL code example from my work on water quality at RegLab. This project aimed to evaluate the impact of a new water quality regulatory policy in California.
The `construct_analysis_dataset` script collects water quality reports from EPA's public data, cleans them for data integrity issues, filters and aggregates observations to the unit of analysis, and joins in metadata from distinct tables.
